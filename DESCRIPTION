Description: UBR provides Bayesian regularization methods for high-dimensional linear regression. The methods implemented in this package leverage a novel data augmentation scheme based on the scale mixture of uniform (SMU) distribution that leads to a set of efficient Gibbs samplers with tractable full conditional posterior distributions and superior performance over existing methods.
